# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a research documentation project analyzing black hat SEO techniques, tools, and underground marketplaces for educational and defensive security purposes. The project consists of HTML-based terminal-style documentation sites and markdown research files.

## Project Structure

```
/New Reports/          # Primary HTML documentation files
  - ULTIMATE-BLACKHAT-GUIDE-2025.html (main comprehensive guide)
  - blackhat-terminal-*.html (various terminal-styled versions)
  - *.md (case studies, research notes)
  - ARCHIVED DATA/ (historical research)

/NEWDATA/             # Extracted content and analysis
  - CONTENT_ANALYSIS.md (detailed content mapping)
  - extracted-content-all-sections.md
  - blackhat-seo-terminal-v2.html

## File Naming Conventions

HTML files follow terminal/hacker aesthetic naming:
- `blackhat-terminal-*.html` - Terminal-styled documentation
- `blackhat-seo-terminal-v*.html` - Versioned terminal interfaces
- `*-final.html` - Final versions (though multiple "final" versions exist)
- `.bak.html` - Backup versions

## HTML Documentation Architecture

### Terminal Theme Design
All HTML files use a consistent retro terminal aesthetic:
- **Color scheme**: Classic green terminal (#00ff41) on black background
- **Fonts**: Share Tech Mono, IBM Plex Mono (monospace)
- **Effects**: CRT scanlines, screen glow, text shadows
- **Layout**: Full-screen terminal interface with navigation tabs

### Content Structure
Documentation is organized into major sections:
1. **Overview** - Statistics, ecosystem analysis, risk assessments
2. **Search Manipulation** - Cloaking, AI exploitation, PBN techniques
3. **Affiliate SEO** - Parasite hosting, content farms
4. **Local SEO** - GPS spoofing, fake reviews, GMB manipulation
5. **Tools Database** - 42 documented tools with pricing
6. **Case Studies** - Real-world examples (gambling networks, pharma, malware)
7. **Underground Marketplace** - Pricing tables for services
8. **Detection & Defense** - Google's systems, protection strategies
9. **Resources** - Forums, Telegram channels, communities

### Key Content Elements
- **Data tables**: 19+ comprehensive comparison tables
- **Statistics**: 400+ metrics tracking market size, detection rates, pricing
- **Code examples**: 8 technical implementations (Lambda@Edge, ML detection, etc.)
- **Collapsible sections**: 50+ expandable deep-dive subsections
- **Operator quotes**: Real practitioner insights throughout

## Common Tasks

### Editing HTML Documentation

When modifying HTML files:
1. Maintain terminal aesthetic (green text, monospace fonts, CRT effects)
2. Keep data tables structured with proper HTML table markup
3. Preserve collapsible section functionality (details/summary tags)
4. Update statistics and pricing data as needed
5. Ensure ASCII art and terminal borders remain aligned

### Adding New Content

When adding sections:
- Follow existing card-based layout structure
- Include metrics boxes (effectiveness %, detection risk, pricing)
- Add collapsible subsections for deep technical details
- Include code examples in proper `<pre><code>` blocks
- Add operator quotes/insights for authenticity

### Working with Data

Key data files:
- `CONTENT_ANALYSIS.md` - Complete section mapping and gap analysis
- Shows original file has 5,631 lines, 301KB of content
- Documents all 42 tools, 19 tables, 3 case studies, 400+ metrics

## Important Context

**Ethical Boundaries**: This is defensive security research documenting black hat techniques for educational purposes. When working with this code:
- Only help with HTML formatting, content organization, and documentation
- Do not create new exploit code or automation tools
- Focus on information architecture and presentation
- Maintain educational/research context throughout

## Content Completeness

According to CONTENT_ANALYSIS.md, current rewrites are approximately 30-40% complete compared to the original comprehensive file. Missing elements include:
- 60-70% of detailed data tables
- All 3 complete case studies with financial breakdowns
- Advanced AI Exploitation mega-section (6 subsections)
- Advanced Cloaking Infrastructure section (6 subsections)
- ~22 of 42 tools with complete pricing
- Technical code implementations
- Complete marketplace pricing intelligence

## File Dependencies

- No build process or package managers
- Standalone HTML files with embedded CSS/JavaScript
- External dependencies: Google Fonts (IBM Plex Mono, Share Tech Mono)
- Images referenced from /Black Hat Personas/ and /Social Pics/

## Version Control

This repository is not currently a git repository. Multiple versions of files exist with various naming conventions (.bak, -final, -v2, -UPDATED, -RESTORE, -WC).
