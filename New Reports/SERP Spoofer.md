SERP Spoofing: Black Hat SEO Tactics for Search Manipulation

Executive Summary

SERP spoofing is a black-hat SEO tactic where a site presents different content or snippets to search engines versus real users, tricking Google’s search results (SERPs) and deceiving users. In essence, the attacker manipulates titles, descriptions or rich snippets so that search listings appear relevant or authoritative, while the actual pages are unrelated or malicious ￼ ￼. This can include fake FAQ or product snippets, cloaked redirects, brand-impersonating domains, or malware-laden pages disguised as legitimate sites. The goal is often to siphon clicks, leads or trust from competitors, affiliates, or branded searches.

Why it matters: Spoofed search results damage user trust and legitimate businesses. Users may click a search result expecting one thing (e.g. a product or review) and instead land on malware, spam or ads, risking data theft and brand damage ￼ ￼. Organic rankings and click-through rates (CTR) become unreliable as spoofing pushes honest results lower in SERPs ￼ ￼. Google actively fights these practices: sites using deceptive snippets or schemas risk manual penalties, ranking drops, or deindexing ￼ ￼. In competitive niches (gambling, crypto, affiliates, etc.), attackers often turn to SERP spoofing for quick traffic spikes, making awareness and detection critical for SEOs and auditors.

Operator Personas

Black-hat operators often fit certain “roles” or specialties. Below are common personas, their goals, tools, behaviors, SEO impact, risk levels, and detection clues:
	•	Parasite Host – The Domain Abuser. This operator hacks or exploits high-authority sites (e.g. universities, news portals) to host spammy pages or redirects ￼ ￼. Using automated scripts or stolen credentials, they inject keyword-rich pages or hidden backlinks (“parasite hosting”) on the victim domain, leveraging its trust to rank malicious content high. Often paired with cloaking scripts, the page shows benign content to site owners and a phishing/money site to Googlebot ￼ ￼. Impact: Can temporarily outrank legitimate sites and steal referral traffic. Risk: High – the compromised site may get “This site may be hacked” warnings in SERPs ￼ or manual actions. Detection: Check Search Console for unexpected pages, monitor server logs for unusual Googlebot activity, and compare Google’s cached version to live pages ￼ ￼.
	•	Snippet Spoofer – The Schema Shifter. This specialist fabricates or abuses structured data (FAQ, HowTo, Product, Review markup) to generate rich snippets that don’t reflect real content. For example, adding a fake FAQ Q&A schema to appear in Google’s snippets, or marking up invisible “review” stars on a page without genuine reviews. Goal: Increase SERP real estate (stars, FAQ dropdowns) and CTR with clickbait snippets. Tools: Schema plugins, JS to inject hidden elements, or CMS edits. Impact: Improved CTR and prominence until caught. Risk: Moderate–Google penalizes “spammy” or irrelevant markup ￼. Sites face manual actions if caught using fake reviews or hidden schema ￼. Detection: Search Console’s Rich Results report will flag schema errors or mismatches; review page source for unexpected JSON-LD or microdata.
	•	Domain Impersonator – The Brand Hijacker. These operators register lookalike or typo-squatting domains (e.g. goog1e.com, facbook-payments.net) or clone content from trusted brands. They then use SEO (on-page and off-page) to rank these spoof domains for branded or generic keywords. Goal: Capture traffic intended for the real brand (phishing, affiliate commissions). Tools: Domain registrars, content cloaking, and ad exchanges. Impact: Lowers click share for the genuine brand, confuses users. Risk: Moderate – often a cat-and-mouse game as trademark owners or Google quickly intervene. Detection: Watch for unusual referral domains, check brand-name Google results for unfamiliar domains. Even Google warns of “SERP-Hijacking & Brand Spoofing” tactics where a fake site appears as a known brand ￼.
	•	Cache Abuser – The Cache Cloaker. This operator exploits Google Cache or Internet Archive to show honest content to crawlers while serving spammy pages to users. For instance, a page might appear normal (e.g. search “site:example.com games” shows a game site in cache) but actually redirects visitors to an unrelated download/malware site. Goal: Trick site owners (and SEOs) via the cached copy, and hide malicious redirection from casual inspection. Tools: Conditional redirects (302/301), “first-click” scripts. Impact: Allows spam pages to rank under legitimate URLs. Risk: High – Googlebot vs visitor content mismatch is bannable. Detection: Compare Google’s cached version to the live page ￼. If cache shows a normal page but the live site is all spam/adware, it’s a red flag.
	•	AI Overlay Engineer – The Fake Preview Creator. A newer tactic where attackers generate fake SERP previews or overlays using AI tools. For example, a site or extension might display an on-page graphic mimicking Google’s search UI with manipulated snippets (sometimes called “SERP previewers”). Goal: Convince users they’re on Google Search when clicking, possibly to prompt login or install malware. Tools: Custom web scripts, AI-based image generation. Impact: Very high user deception (people think they saw a real Google result). Risk: High – likely gets flagged as fraudulent UI. Detection: Technical analysis of front-end code reveals fake Google assets or overlays; users can identify inconsistencies (no real Google toolbar, etc.).
	•	Clickjacking Developer – The Invisible Clicker. This operator overlays hidden iframes or UI elements on the SERP or landing pages. For instance, a search results page might be framed inside a malicious page, capturing clicks. Goal: Force users into clicking elements they didn’t intend (e.g. invisible purchase or “like” buttons ￼). Tools: HTML/CSS with transparent iframes. Impact: May drive unintended actions (purchases, installs) while camouflaging source. Risk: Moderate – clickjacking is an old trick, but modern browsers block many methods (via X-Frame-Options etc.). Detection: Check page source for hidden iframes or elements; browsers like Chrome show “clickjacking” indicators.
	•	Adware/Extension Developer – The Browser Hijacker. This persona crafts browser extensions or malware that modifies search results in real time on the client side. For example, after a delay, extra “ad” links or promoted results slide into the Google search page (often visible only to the infected user, not detected by Google). Goal: Monetize search traffic via ad injections or affiliate redirects. Tools: JavaScript-based Chrome/Firefox extensions, malware kits. Impact: Spoofs live SERP for the end-user (not Google), leading to hidden affiliate revenue. Risk: Moderate – offending extensions get blacklisted, but users often unknowingly keep them. Detection: As one user reported, extra “commercial results” appear only in normal Chrome mode and vanish in Incognito, indicating an extension is injecting them ￼. Checking browser extensions and performing Google searches in a clean browser is a quick check ￼.

Client Personas

Who pays for SERP spoofing and why? Typical clients include affiliates, marketers, and even criminals who prioritize immediate traffic or brand manipulation over compliance:
	•	Affiliate Marketers (iGaming, VPN, Crypto, etc.): High-margin industries like online casino, sports betting, VPNs and emerging crypto/DeFi projects often use aggressive SEO. QuoIntelligence found large-scale affiliate campaigns impersonating known gambling brands and spamming search rankings with AI-generated content ￼ ￼. These clients seek top positions for lucrative keywords during seasonal promotions (Black Friday, affiliate races, etc.). They use black-hat SEO to drive affiliate conversions, treating SERP manipulation as part of their strategy ￼ ￼.
	•	Competitive Businesses (Lead Gen, Finance, Health): Companies in loans, insurance, weight-loss, or pills niches – where ranking first can mean massive revenue – may hire “grey hat” SEO to bury competitors or negative stories. They aim to flood the SERPs (often through fake content or hijacked pages) so their own or friendly sites appear in top results. Landingi notes that in verticals where visibility “can directly impact revenue (affiliates, e-commerce, short-lived campaigns) … black hat tactics [like SERP spoofing] are appealing” ￼. Some even use negative SEO (targeting rivals) or domain takeovers to achieve this.
	•	Reputation Managers: Organizations concerned about unfavorable search results (bad reviews, news, legal issues) may resort to spoofing tactics to bury negativity. By pushing “spoofed” positive or irrelevant pages to the top, they hope to suppress bad content. This desperation-driven use is risky, as discovered spam can worsen reputational damage with Google penalties or legal action.
	•	Cybercriminals & Scammers: Malicious actors selling malware or phishing services use SEO poisoning. For instance, a reported campaign used SEO tactics to push fake app sites (malware-laden) to the top of Google for popular app names ￼. These “clients” seek only to harvest installs or credentials, not caring about legitimacy. Such use-cases underscore that spammy search tactics are not confined to SEO firms – they can be exploited by anyone with dark intent.

Goals and Desperation: Clients are united by urgency: they want fast traffic or quick suppression of content, often at any cost. Black hat groups promise immediate high rankings, which can be tempting in cutthroat verticals. QuoIntelligence notes fraudsters “employ black hat SEO techniques” at scale to “manipulate search rankings and drive traffic” to their offers ￼ ￼. The desperation is highest among affiliates and shady niches, but even reputable businesses may flirt with these methods under pressure. For those unaware, understanding black hat signals helps vet unreliable SEO offers ￼ ￼.

Spoofing Techniques
	•	Structured Data Manipulation (Fake Snippets): Attackers inject bogus schema (FAQ, HowTo, Product, Review, etc.) into pages to create eye-catching rich snippets. Examples include adding fake “star” reviews or deceptive product details via JSON-LD or hidden HTML. This can display inflated ratings or clickbait FAQ directly in Google’s SERP. Google prohibits markup that doesn’t match on-page content, treating it as snippet spam ￼. Impact: Can temporarily boost clicks with rich features. Risk: Moderate–sites caught with misleading markup face manual penalties or loss of rich results ￼. Detection: Search Console Rich Results report will flag inconsistent or inappropriate markup. Unusual rich snippet types (e.g. stars on non-review pages) are red flags.
	•	Cloaked Redirects or Switcheroos: A page ranks for a query, but when clicked, the user is immediately sent to an unrelated page (often via a 302 redirect or JS) – a classic “switcheroo.” For example, a hacked news site might list for “free games” but silently redirect visitors to a gaming scam site. Googlebot, however, may be shown benign content or a canonical link back to a safe URL, hiding the switch. Tools/Behavior: Conditional scripts that detect referrer or user-agent (only Google sees normal content, real users see ads/malware). Impact: Gains rank and clicks from innocents, while true site content remains unchanged. Risk: High – site will eventually be flagged as hacked or cloaked. As Sucuri demonstrated, such hijacks often trigger a “This site may be hacked” warning in SERPs ￼. Detection: Compare the Google-cached page to the live page ￼. Significant mismatches (real content vs. spam page) indicate a cloaked redirect.
	•	Domain Impersonation / Brand Hijacking: Fake sites imitate a legitimate brand or domain to intercept branded searches. Attackers register domains with similar names or clone a site’s content entirely, then do SEO to rank them. For example, a site like “netflix-login-info.com” might appear high for “Netflix account login.” Tools/Behavior: Content scraping, copycat site design, domain typosquatting. Impact: Directly steals brand traffic and undermines trust (user may not realize they’re on a fake site). Risk: Moderate – the brand will likely issue takedowns, and Google can remove obvious impostors. Detection: Monitor branded search results for unknown domains. Use WHOIS lookup for suspicious domains. Google’s guidelines explicitly call this out as a deceptive practice ￼.
	•	Cache and Archive Abuse (Google Cache Hijacking): Attackers use Google’s cache as camouflage. They ensure Googlebot only sees good content, while visitors see spam or malicious pages. One documented case showed Google’s cached copy as a legitimate “Gametop” site, but clicking the result delivered a scam page with stolen content and ads ￼ ￼. Impact: Makes detection by site owners harder, and ensures Google keeps ranking the fake content. Risk: High – once discovered, Google will deindex the pages. Detection: Always check Google’s “Cached” version of your pages. A cached healthy-looking page versus an actual spam page is a telltale sign ￼.
	•	Clickjacking or Iframe Deception: The attacker embeds search results or site content inside transparent iframes or UI overlays. For example, an iframe displaying Google Search is layered under some clickable element on a malicious page. Users think they clicked a search result, but they actually clicked a hidden button or link ￼. Impact: Can trick users into actions (likes, purchases) on unsuspecting sites. Risk: Moderate – browsers have some protections (X-Frame-Options, anti-clickjacking headers). Detection: Look for unusual iframe usage or hidden layers in the page source. Tools and Content Security Policy logs can reveal iframe-based injections.
	•	Real-Time SERP Overlays in Malware/Adware Extensions: Malicious browser extensions or bundled malware can rewrite the user’s view of Google search results on the fly. After a search query, they inject extra sponsored results or change existing links before the user sees them. Unlike others, this doesn’t change Google’s index, only what the infected user sees. Impact: High – hijacks user attention to attacker-controlled links or ads, often in the top positions. Risk: Moderate – once reported, browser marketplaces (Chrome Web Store) will remove the extension, but many users remain unaware. Detection: Users noticing “extra” sponsored results on Google (especially if Incognito mode shows normal results) ￼. Checking installed extensions (and doing malware scans) usually uncovers the culprit.

SEO Impact & Relationship

SERP spoofing deeply distorts real search results and metrics. Spam pages can occupy coveted top positions, pushing honest sites down – a form of negative SEO by flooding results ￼ ￼. A hijacked SERP entry often displays unrelated or malicious content (e.g. ads, stolen text) that looks out of context, degrading the search experience ￼ ￼. For example, one analysis noted that cheating pages in Google’s index “push down the sites that normally should rank” and can insert ads and spam links into rankings, harming brands and user trust ￼.

Click-through rates (CTR) and user engagement also suffer. When users click a spoofed snippet, they may instantly bounce or complain (“this result lied to me”), raising bounce rates and lowering dwell time. Over time, this skews analytics and diminishes a site’s perceived quality. Moreover, Google’s credibility is at stake: as one report warned, a surge in SEO poisoning “shows you cannot rely solely on search rankings to stay safe” from malicious redirects ￼. In short, SERP spoofing undermines the integrity of search. Legitimate rankings become polluted by irrelevant or fraudulent entries, diluting click equity and undermining the links between query intent and result.

Detection & Forensic Patterns

- Server and Analytics Logs: Sudden spikes in Googlebot activity, or many hits from a single IP (like Google’s) with unusual user-agent, suggest cloaking. Monitor logs for discrepancies: if Googlebot sees one version but normal browsers another, a hack is likely. Tools can flag cases where the site serves different HTML to known Googlebot UAs ￼ ￼.

- Search Console Anomalies: In Search Console, look for new, unrelated pages being indexed (keywords or URLs that don’t match your content), spikes in impressions on odd queries, or sudden drops on normal ones ￼. Check the Security & Manual Actions panel for “Hacked content” or “Unnatural markup” flags. Also, the Rich Results report will list any invalid schema markups, and the Performance report can reveal unnatural keyword rankings (e.g. your site ranking for dozens of irrelevant keywords ￼).

- Google Cache vs. Live Page: A critical test is comparing Google’s cache of your pages with the live site. If the cached version shows correct content but the live page (or vice versa) is spammy or different, that’s a strong spoofing sign ￼ ￼.

- DNS and Hosting History: For domain impersonation, check WHOIS and DNS history. A recently registered or re-pointed domain suddenly ranking for branded terms is suspicious. Likewise, if your legitimate domain’s content unexpectedly changes (via DNS hijack or shenanigans), archival services (Wayback, Archive.org) and Google’s cache can reveal timeline discrepancies.

- User-Agent Fingerprinting: Many cloaking attacks detect Google’s UA or IP range. Security scans emulating Googlebot can flush out differences. For example, in the Sucuri case, using a curl with Googlebot’s UA exposed hidden pornographic content ￼. Similarly, testing searches from different browsers (incognito vs normal, different devices) can highlight injections like malicious extensions ￼.

- Content Scanning & Alerts: Set up Google Alerts or monitoring tools for site:yourdomain.com or specific keywords ￼. Unusual new snippets (especially with obscene or off-topic text) will trigger alerts. Also scan your site’s code for injected <script> or <iframe> patterns, hidden divs or suspicious JS files (parasite hacks often add hidden keyword divs ￼).

Platform Penalties & Timelines

Search engines respond to SERP spoofing with both automated and manual measures. Detection time: Attacks like parasite hosting can linger for weeks or months before Google’s algorithms catch up ￼. In one analysis, sites remained top-ranked despite cloaking “for several weeks” because Google hadn’t yet discovered the subterfuge ￼. However, new algorithmic updates (such as the “Payday Loan 2.0” update) target manipulative tactics and eventually surface these spammy pages ￼.

Penalties: Once caught, penalties range from demotion of specific pages to site-wide actions. Google has issued manual penalties for “spammy structured markup” when sites used fake reviews or hidden snippets ￼. More broadly, Google’s spam policies explicitly ban cloaking and hacked content ￼. Affected sites may see all spoofed pages dropped from results, removal of rich snippets, and possibly a “This site may be hacked” warning box ￼. Ultimately, the offender may be partially or entirely deindexed.

Recovery timelines: Cleanup and reconsideration can take weeks. Google’s review of fixed issues (reconsideration requests) also takes time (often days or weeks) ￼. During this period, any SERP rankings manipulated by spoofing vanish. Even after remediation, trust must be rebuilt; sites hit by these penalties can endure prolonged ranking volatility. In sum, the cost of detection is severe: lost traffic, damaged reputation, and the arduous process of regaining Google’s trust.

White-Hat Equivalents

Every black-hat SEO technique has a legitimate counterpart:
	•	Honest Structured Data: Use schema markup to enhance user experience, not to deceive. For example, add genuine FAQ content or reviews in your HTML (not hidden) so that rich snippets naturally reflect your page. Google advises focusing on “relevant, up-to-date, original content that will actually help a user” rather than trying to “find loopholes” for snippets ￼ ￼. Properly implemented structured data (recipes, products, Q&A, etc.) can improve CTR without risk if it genuinely matches your content.
	•	Canonical Content and Authority Building: Instead of spoofing or piggybacking on others’ domains, build real authority. Invest in high-quality backlinks, content marketing, and brand-building. Earned links and genuine citations help Google know your site is authoritative. The black-hat parasite tactics rely on stolen authority; the white-hat path is to grow your own reputation organically.
	•	Accurate Metadata: Write truthful, compelling title tags and meta descriptions that match your page’s content. This improves CTR in a sustainable way. Misleading titles (clickbait) can count as “bad user experience” signals. A good practice is to follow Google’s guidance: titles should succinctly describe the content and provide a good summary ￼.
	•	Content Quality & Relevance: Ultimately, the best “equivalent” is exceptional content that users love. As one expert puts it, white-hat SEO is about “crafting high-quality content that captivates users, optimizing for relevant keywords, and earning links through trust and authority” ￼. Focus on solving user queries, answer real questions, and fulfill search intent. Over time, this builds lasting rankings without risk of spam penalties.

In summary, legitimate SEO (white-hat) builds traffic by serving users, not by tricking search engines. Black-hat “spoof” tricks might yield short-term wins, but ethical strategies yield long-term, penalty-free growth.

Layout & Visual Recommendations

To make this guide clear and actionable, use a mix of visuals and structured elements:
	•	Infoboxes and Callouts: Highlight definitions and key warnings in colored boxes (e.g. “Tip:” or “Warning:”). For instance, an infobox could define “spoof chain” or emphasize the risk of schema spam. ￼ (Cite at box start.)
	•	Diagrams: Include flowcharts or diagrams. One useful diagram is a “spoof chain”: illustrating the attack flow (e.g. Hacker → Hacked Site → Googlebot → Malicious Landing Page). Another could show how a fake snippet appears in SERP versus the real content. These visual aids help readers grasp complex patterns at a glance.
	•	Checklists and Tables: Provide a Checklist for Spotting Spoofing (see next section) as a bullet list or table. Use tables to compare “Black Hat Tactic vs. Legitimate Practice” or to summarize penalties and detection methods.
	•	Formatting Tips: Keep paragraphs short. Use bullets and numbered lists for steps or red flags. For example, an infographic-style list of “Quick Tips” (e.g. “Always check Google Cache” or “Monitor Search Console daily”) can stand out visually.
	•	Screenshots: Where possible, include annotated screenshots. For instance, a legitimate vs. spoofed Google snippet (with clarifying arrows) can be highly instructive. If images are used (e.g. of SERPs or code injections), caption them succinctly and cite sources if from a study or article (e.g. “Example of a hijacked SERP where a hacked site shows spammy titles ￼”).

Overall, the layout should guide auditors through detection steps, use callouts to emphasize tactics, and present technical info in digestible form (like highlighting user-agent checks or Search Console fields). The goal is to make a downloadable, training-friendly format: so plenty of headings, bold text for terms, and diagrams/checklists that can be pulled out as slides or one-pagers.

Glossary

SERP Spoofing: Manipulating search results to display deceptive titles, URLs or snippets. For example, dynamically altering the title tag for Google’s crawler so the SERP shows a clickbait title that doesn’t appear on the real page ￼. Often synonymous with “search result poisoning” or “SEO poisoning.”

Cloaking: Serving different content to search engines than to users, with intent to deceive Google’s ranking algorithms ￼. For instance, showing a travel page to Googlebot but serving a page about drugs to actual visitors. Cloaking is strictly disallowed.

Parasite Hosting: Hosting pages on another site (without consent) to exploit its authority ￼. In SEO terms, a parasite host uses a high-authority domain to rank keyword-stuffed content or redirects, essentially freeloading on someone else’s reputation ￼ ￼.

Rich Snippet Spam (Schema Spam): Adding bogus structured data (reviews, FAQs, products, etc.) to pages to generate rich snippets that mislead users. Google’s Rich Snippet Quality Guidelines forbid markup that is irrelevant or hidden. Sites found doing this have been penalized for “spammy structured markup” ￼.

Cache Hijack: A tactic where the Google-cached version of a page shows benign content, but the live page is malicious or redirected. Attackers may rely on Google’s cache to hide their changes; if only the cached content is seen by Googlebot, the real malicious behavior goes unnoticed until later ￼ ￼.

Fake SERP Overlay / Previewer: A synthetic interface mimicking Google’s search page, often generated by an app or extension. It displays a fraudulent SERP (maybe created by AI) so that when a user clicks, they are actually on a malicious site.

Clickjacking: A UI redressing attack where invisible elements trick users into clicking unintended targets ￼. In the context of SERP spoofing, it could involve overlaying an iframe of Google search results over a page to capture clicks or to redirect clicks to malicious content.

Domain/Brand Impersonation (SERP Hijacking): Using a domain or content that mimics a known brand so that the fake site appears in brand-name searches. This hijacking of brand SERPs can mislead users into visiting an imposter site ￼.

Cached Response Switcheroo: Serving users a different response (often a redirect) when they click from Google, compared to the response given to other visitors. In practice, it’s a form of cloaking using referrer checks or session scripts.

Rich Snippet Hijacking / Farming: Forcing your site to show up in search snippets with bogus content (e.g. fake reviews). Sometimes called “snippet farming,” it abuses Google’s snippet formats.

DNS/302 Hijack: Altering DNS records or using temporary (302) redirects to misdirect traffic. For example, changing the canonical or 302 target only for Google’s requests.

One-Page Audit Checklist

Top Red Flags for Site Owners, SEOs & Platforms:
	•	Unexpected Pages in SERPs: If a site:yourdomain.com search shows URLs or content you didn’t create (spammy subdomains, odd query parameters, “hidden” pages), investigate immediately. Use Google Alerts on site:yourdomain.com to catch new indexed pages ￼.
	•	Title/Description Mismatch: A search snippet title or description that doesn’t match your visible page content (e.g. showing keywords/brand names not on your page) suggests snippet spoofing. Also, compare the Google Cached version of the page with the live page; discrepancies mean cloaking ￼.
	•	Security Warnings in Search: Look for “This site may be hacked” or malware warnings in your SERPs. These indicate Google detected spam or hacking, often due to spoofing ￼.
	•	Rich Snippet Warnings: Check Search Console for structured data errors. An alert about “spammy markup” or any removal of rich results likely means someone tried to manipulate snippets ￼.
	•	Unusual Rankings/Keywords: If your site suddenly ranks for dozens of irrelevant keywords (especially low-value or adult terms), it may be hacked/poisoned. Monitor your Search Console Performance report for such anomalies ￼.
	•	Analytics Spikes: Sudden traffic surges from organic that then immediately bounce out can indicate a malicious redirect. A spike followed by a crash in CTR (with high impressions) is suspicious.
	•	Incognito vs. Regular Search Differences: Test Google searches in Chrome’s Incognito. If results differ (extra ads or links only in normal mode), an extension or adware may be injecting content ￼.
	•	DNS or Hosting Changes: Check if your domain’s DNS or hosting was altered without authorization. Tools like SecurityTrails or DNSHistory can show if someone pointed your domain to a different server or used an expired domain irregularly.
	•	Hidden Content: Scan your site’s HTML/CSS for hidden elements (e.g. <div style="display:none"> filled with keywords or links, or unauthorized iframes). Tools like Sucuri SiteCheck can detect hidden spam scripts.
	•	Googlebot Access: Use Google’s URL Inspection in Search Console to fetch your page as Googlebot. If you see different HTML than a normal browser fetch, something’s wrong.
	•	Extension Checks: If you suspect local SERP injection, disable all browser extensions or try another clean browser. If the issue disappears, narrow down which extension is malicious.

By systematically verifying these items, site owners and auditors can spot SERP spoofing early. Any confirmed spoofing should be immediately cleaned (remove hacks, fix markup) and reported via Google’s webmaster tools and security channels to stop the damage.
